# Michael!

Steve Holt! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Marry me. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

I care deeply for nature. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. **Get me a vodka rocks.** _And a piece of toast._ Across from where?

## That's why you always leave a note!

I'm a monster. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. That's why you always leave a note! I hear the jury's still out on science. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"

1. Well, what do you expect, mother?
2. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.
3. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!

### Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.

Well, what do you expect, mother? No… but I'd like to be asked! Steve Holt! No… but I'd like to be asked! Guy's a pro. We just call it a sausage.

- We just call it a sausage.
- That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'
- Guy's a pro.

Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I hear the jury's still out on science. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Army had half a day. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

We just call it a sausage. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

Army had half a day. I'm a monster. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I'm afraid I just blue myself. That's why you always leave a note!

Not tricks, Michael, illusions. We just call it a sausage. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Marry me. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.
