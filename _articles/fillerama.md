# The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Soon enough. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

I wish! It's a nickel. Yeah, lots of people did. They're like sex, except I'm having them! **We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.** _Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me._ Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

## No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

Is that a cooking show? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I love you, buddy! Bender, we're trying our best.

1. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.
2. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
3. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

### Moving along…

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?

- Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!
- Fatal.
- Ask her how her day was.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I wish! It's a nickel.

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Ooh, name it after me! Say it in Russian! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!

Kids have names? With gusto. And until then, I can never die? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Can I use the gun? No! The cat shelter's on to me. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Shinier than yours, meatbag. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Bite my shiny metal ass. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Bender, quit destroying the universe!

Actually, that's still true. That's not soon enough! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
